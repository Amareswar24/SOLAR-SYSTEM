# Solar System Visualization: A 2D Dynamic Model of Planetary Orbits

## Project Overview

The *Solar System Visualization* project simulates the orbits of the planets in our solar system in 2D space. The simulation visually represents planetary movement based on orbital parameters such as radius and speed, allowing users to observe the motion of planets around the Sun. The simulation is built using Python and visualized using the `matplotlib` library, with additional use of `numpy` for numerical calculations.

### Key Features:
- Real-time simulation of planetary orbits
- User-adjustable orbital speed via a slider
- Visualization of the solar system with planetary orbits
- Interactive user interface with zoom, pan, and speed controls
- Accurate representations of planetary positions and distances

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- ipywidgets (for interactive controls)
